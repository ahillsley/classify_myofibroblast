# Calculating morphological features of cells
1) Download the feature_extraction folder
2) Run StatsCalc.py 
    - Need to change folder names and locations
    - Outputs CSV with cell properties and kNN and dTree predictions of activation
3) Run run_mSVM4.m
    - need to change folder names and locations
    - adds SVM model prediction to output csv
